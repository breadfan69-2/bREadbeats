hELLO claude!  you have helped me building this program from scratch for a week now!   we are close....

please take a look at the code, and check out any old instructions/ documentations and[agent_reference]- get an understanding....and look at recent commits in this experimental branch which we are working in:https://github.com/breadfan69-2/bREadbeats/tree/feature/metric-autoranging

so you can see where we are at.



lets work on the effects/axis tab now

consolodate vibration/creep to a single groupbox labeled "effects"
-windowshade

no need for any () explaining what they are, simply jitter and creep please for labels

can the "modes 1-3, mode 4 be put in a tooltip when mouse over those sliders?   appropriate tooltip for the current mode?


oh by the way, there seems to be a bit of a bug where the windowshade opens the groupbox and draws the controls but doesn't connect them.  froaze! closing/opening the windowshade makes them work. please investigate.
