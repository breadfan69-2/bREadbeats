SESSION SUMMARY - February 11, 2026
=====================================

COMPLETED TASKS:
1. Moved frequency range selection indicators from menu bar to individual per-slider checkboxes
   - Added "Show" checkboxes next to Beat Band, Depth Band, P0 Band, and F0 Band sliders
   - Removed "Show (Frequency) Range Selection Indicators" from menu
   - Implemented individual toggle methods for each band

2. Investigated TCode sending parameters 
   - Confirmed TCode commands are only sent when playing (sending_enabled gating works correctly)
   - No commands sent when not playing

3. Created Advanced Controls dialog
   - New "Advanced Controls..." menu option
   - Dialog with warning message about experimental features
   - Unlock toggle to enable access (placeholder for future advanced settings)

4. Implemented auto-align target BPM feature
   - Checkbox to enable/disable auto-alignment with sensed BPM
   - Configurable stability check value (spinbox 2-10, default 5)
   - Feature gradually aligns target BPM when tempo is stable

5. Fixed volume ramp behavior on pause
   - Added send_immediate() method to NetworkEngine to bypass queue
   - Volume now immediately fades to zero when pausing (not queued)
   - Send immediate commands bypass sending_enabled check for critical operations

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
- main.py: Added per-slider toggle methods, Advanced Controls dialog, auto-align BPM system, immediate volume fade
- network_engine.py: Added send_immediate() method for critical commands
- All changes tested and verified working

STATUS: All requested features implemented and functional
