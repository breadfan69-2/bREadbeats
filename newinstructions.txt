hi claude,

shades and groupboxes look good.  i need a little more.  i want our visualizer to get their full value.

lets start with the beat detection tab

[real time metrics}
change groupbox title to [auto-adjust] and put a global checkbox for the metric functions in/next to the groupbox title.  
-move butterworth filter to metrics groupbox, since its mandatory.

-default load shade closed, always; global toggle "on" for first load, then save in config 



{frequency band slider}
is frequency band slider locked/frozen when in auto mode? ok if so, but it should have an indication.  Ghost slider?
-we can move it to the 'levels' groupbox.  the orphaned groupbox can be deleted.


{more shades}
add window shades for the levels and peaks groupboxes please

we'll work on the stroke settings tab next
