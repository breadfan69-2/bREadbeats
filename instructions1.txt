i think our journey may have come to an end for the moment

i need you to gather up all recent changes, make sure you get them all, we've done some stuff here@  and in other chat sessions possibly.  but everything is perfect right now i think.

so double, triple check that we have recent changes gathered, commit, and push to repo

then build exe for me with all hidden imports/dependancies etc.  make sure to check for new modules/imports/dependancies and add to breadbeats.spec if necessary
