So, claude, you wrote this program, but my intellectual property put the logic together, with some help from random internet resources.   



Can you look it over for any copywright or license infringement?   are those resources available to you?

-I've put over 100, probably closer to 200 hrs into prompting you to create this software.  
 -I don't want others to be able to profit from it, it should always be freeware.  what kind of license do i need?
-I want mods/changes to always be shared with me.


i THINK i need you to put together a creative commons non commercial license for me, is that correct?  does that include the "must share" addendum?

i need you to put together the appropriate license for my software.

be sure license text comes from official source

set it up in the repo for me

 
when you're done with the license.  please take a super close look at the code
