 cheaper claude did some stuff here, but can you check his work?  mainly the wiring of the new and re-arranged sliders.
----------------------------------
 i love the new dropdown menu, can it be called "menu" instead of "file"?  
to keep up with standard windows styling we should also put a "close" function on it.
May as well set up a "load presets" function too, open a file chooser to pick a .json

----------------------------
  we need to add a display for sent [carrier_freq] value, same as [pulse_freq].
is there room directly above the [pulse_freq] display?
--------------------------------
can we change all the doubled up min/max sliders(one ranging function, 2 whole sliders) to the ranging style with 2 draggable tabs?(one ranging function, one slider with 2 tabs)?   it would save a lot of space.
