RE: ADDITIONS TO NEW METRIC BASED AUTORANGE:

**- add {audio amplification} to the metric based autorange system:
-if no beats detected for [xxx]ms raise [audio amplification]2% of availablerange every (1100?)ms. 
    -should use same [value from target BPS spinboxes and any other [lost beat] functions should follow same target bps

-do the same implementation for [sensitivity] but based on [downbeat][no downbeat].  [no downbeat]= raise sensitivity 4% of available range

-reverse these parameters when number of Beats is insanely excessive


Make these changes, test/verify, commit and push to this experimental branch.  do not include any instruction(#),instructions in commit.  if there are any files like this on remote, show them to me so we can discuss deletion.
