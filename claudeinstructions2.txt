hi claude,
GPT keeps fucking things up.

I'm trying to build EXE but it won't run once built.  I think dependencies are missing.   Please look into the codebase and requirements.txt and edit to automatically include anything that's not already.

---  check that buildspec file is correct and has icons for windows explorer AND GUI window/windows taskbar,

--be sure buildspec includes .json instructions for presets if necessary, and saves user config breadbeats.json and breadbeats.ini in same folder as exe is run from.

--- exe filename is "bREadbeats".   spec should not include console build but i want console for this build only

-----------------------------

also, in the GUI: "controls" box things are getting smushed/distorted, please fix layout.
