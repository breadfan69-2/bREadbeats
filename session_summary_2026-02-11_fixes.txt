SESSION SUMMARY - February 11, 2026
===================================

CHANGES MADE:
=============

1. AUTO-ALIGN BPM FIX (main.py, lines 6257-6295)
   Problem: Target BPM spinbox never updated because round(int + 0.3) = same int
   Solution: Changed to +1/-1 integer stepping with ceil/floor direction clamping
   Impact: Auto-align feature now works correctly, updates 1 BPM per cycle
   Commit: 997dfad

2. START/STOP vs PLAY/PAUSE TCODE LOGIC REFACTOR (main.py, lines 5512-5559)
   Problem: Unclear distinction between Start/Stop (audio) and Play/Pause (motion)
   Changes:
   - Start: Enables TCode pipeline immediately, sends V0=0
   - Play: Ramps volume 0→set over 1.3s (was 0.8s), does NOT toggle sending_enabled
   - Pause: Sends V0=0 immediately, keeps TCode pipeline active
   - Stop: Sends V0=0, disables TCode, stops all engines
   Impact: Responsive volume control, proper state separation
   Commit: 997dfad

3. DEFAULT BEAT DETECTION FREQUENCY RANGE (config.py, line 32)
   Changed: freq_high: 200.0 Hz → 150.0 Hz
   Range: 30-200 Hz → 30-150 Hz (bass focus)
   Scope: Applies to fresh installs and users without saved config
   Note: Existing remote's saved config.json (~/.bREadbeats/config.json) will override
   Commit: 0895500

4. REPOSITORY CLEANUP
   Deleted: instructions.txt, session_notes_2026-02-11_spectrogram.txt, session_summary_2026-02-11.txt
   Reason: Temporary files, not part of core codebase
   Commit: 235ab76
