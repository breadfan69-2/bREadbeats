please show me the difference between our local copy of agent_reference and remote copy

i want to confirm recent local changes are correct and do not negate anything important that is saved on remote.

after we have confirmed this, commit and push.

then, i want to add a splash screen on startup while the program is loading. 

I need you to create a graphic for the splash screen. It should use a modified version of our icon file [bbicon.png], you may need to resize.   Overlay the png image with text that we will create using reference from:

The text will say "Please wait, loading BeatTracker modules...."
