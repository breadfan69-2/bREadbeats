wow we are down to silly little UI tweaks!   hooray! 

except:
RE:STROKEMAPPING/RETURN FUNCTION  (take a good look at this code [re: strokemapper/creep/jitter/other effects] and previous commits involving strokemapping/jitter/creep/return, especially earlier ones.  I liked how it worked better a few days ago.)
-it seems like there are a lot of straight lines being drawn when setting up for the next beat.   is there a designated position for return?  there does not need to me, it just needs to smoothly go back to the beat, always continuing on a sinusoidal arc.  arc size can vary, but the motion needs to stay smooth and "loopy".   the "return" function may actually be causing more jumping/teleporting?  mabye we need to send a minimum duration with EVERY command?  say 200ms?  remember we also have to keep sending 100% live data, never que anything.

RE:REMOVAL OF TEST EQUIPMENT [other]->[performance]
-we can remove the "enable spectrum visualizer" selection box and its wiring.  was for testing purposes.
-we can remove the "high pass filter" and all its wiring.
-keep the spectrum updates and FFT dropdowns, but move them next to each other instead of stacking.
-move [butterworth bandpass filter] checkbox and function to [beat detection] tab.


RE:SPECTRUM VISUALIZERS AND RANGE
-lets change the range of all {audio frequency} selector sliders back to 21000hz.  and remove any clamping that may have been in place.  [beatdetection]-[low/high freq sliders],[strokesettings]-[depthfreq low/high]
-can we add a checkbox to hide visualizer range indicators ?  placement: bottom of window between visualizer dropdown and {whipthellama}button.


RE: VOLUME DROP ON [SILENCE]
-i don't see this happening.  i don't see it in restim, i don't see it in console, i don't see it on volume slider.  are we sending proper 4 digit tcode? (V0[xxxx]) with [0001-9999] range?  I feel like this function never got connected properly.  I see [silence] and [fade] in the console but i don't see volume changing anywhere.  if you don't recall, its supposed to be a 15% reduction after 1500ms of silence, and fade back up to previous setting when no longer silent over 500ms

RE: ADDITIONAL TCODE CONTROLS  first, read this:  [https://github.com/multiaxis/TCode-Specification] | and check at [git/diglet48/restim] for proper tcode-restim tagging.
-add a new tcode axis, [FREQUENCY].   this will also be controlled by [audio_dominant_frequency] in the same manner as [pulse_frequency].   add a groupbox for identical controls on the [other] tab.

-for both [FREQUENCY] AND [PULSE_FREQUENCY]  add a new mode to be weighted by dot speed.  mode will be selected by a toggle placed in the groupbox with each function.  mode types=[hz](controlled by [dominant_frequency] / [speed](controlled by dot speed).  also a checkbox to invert commands for the selected mode.
