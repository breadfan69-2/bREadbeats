wow we are down to silly little UI tweaks!   hooray!    

we can remove the "enable spectrum visualizer" selection box and its wiring.  was for testing purposes.

is it not possible to only show spectrum visualizer ending at 18000hz?   past 18000 is useless information, beyond audible.  if we can set the end limits of all visualizers to 18000hz would be perfect.  if not possible to change actual visualizer display range, please reset all {frequency} sliders to have maximum hz matching visualizer display.
