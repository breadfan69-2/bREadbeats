the mountain range visualizer is better!   but i like the other 2 better....the new bar graph one is PERFECT.   If we could make that kind of color and flow on the waterfall, that would be really good too!

mabye you can even find something prettier here, this one really looks ideal "spectrograph" :https://github.com/nickcercone/spectrogram



purely pretty, not very functional for our purpose, but perhaps could add as a nice visualizatoin only function, to be used after settings are all dialed in- https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm

check out those repos and see if we can add those types of visualizers too ok?   the "purely pretty" one we would want a fullscreen mode for ;-)
