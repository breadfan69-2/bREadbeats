RE: RECENT CHANGE TO AUDIO DOMINANT FREQ SELECTION INDICATORS
-the correct orientation now, but only the "beat" indicator box is tall enough.  the other three have a good height difference between themselves, but are much too short compared to "beat".   

-labels all need to go at the top of their respective box, within the box.  their height differnce should be such that the labels will stack.
-----------------------------------------
(old instruction)
RE: AUDIO AMPLIFICATION auto function?
-can we add an automatic function, when in "play" state processing audio and generating motion, if silence is NOT detected, and no beats are detected, to automatically raise [beat detection][audio amplification]value slowly (1.0/750ms) until beat/tempo is detected?    Then, if we are detecting beats more than 1x/300ms, or a tempo over 200bpm(actual)- reverse function until under (1x/300ms)(200bpm) threshhold? this function can have a toggle labeled "auto" next to the "audio amplification" slider. 
-can we do this toggleable function for all of the sliders in beat detection tab?  (not frequency rangeslider)
peak floor would need to lower on no beat/tempo
peak decay would need to lower on no beat/tempo
rise sensitivity- i'm not sure which way it has which effect.  It needs to be more sensetive to rises when no beat/tempo.


(new instruction)
-this works!   but we need the same function for:
-sensitivity
-flux multiplier

-change the reverse function beat/tempo limit to:(1.0/428ms)(140bpm), these numbers match unlike the original imiplementation

-add a toggle next to 'detection type' dropdown label{auto-range} function-global toggle all auto function toggles
------------------------------------------------------------

RE: 'HELP' POPUP
(old instruction)
-reformat text to take less horizontal space, window isn't wide enough.  Buttons should be groupboxed with their corresponding text.

-should be able to click behind popup while it's open.


----additions to menu bar:help: (added proposed auto-ranging button)

No Motion?
Check [options][audio device] is your current speakers or an input/microphone with an incoming signal?
Check [start](starts audio stream detection and visualizer) and [play](starts motion generation) are pressed.
Toggle start/stop, play/pause.
[beat detection] tab -> raise sensitivity, raise audio amplification until you see blinking next to BPM meter or toggle "auto". [button](toggle proposed auto audio amplification)    Best when both lights are blinking and stable beat count displayed. 
[beat detection] adjust frequency range monitored
enable automatic beat detection ranging - [button](toggle all proposed auto functions to "on") 


Still no motion?
[stroke settings]
Check stroke min/max slider [button](resets [strokesettings][stroke min/max] to 0/100 or full range)
Check stroke fullness slider [button](resets [strokesettings][stroke fullness]slider to 100 or maximum range)
Check peak floor [button]

If using strokemode 1,2,3 
[effects/axis]
If using strokemode 1,2,3 check axis weights sliders.  0 = no motion.  [button](resets [effects/axis][a/b axis weights] sliders to 1.0)


Too much motion?
Check [audio device] audio amplification, sensitivity, flux multiplier.
Check [effects/axis] axis weights sliders
Check [tempo tracking] Spectral flux control


(new instruction)
make sure "enable/disable" all auto button includes the functions that we are adding this time, the forgotton ones on the "beat detection" tab.
