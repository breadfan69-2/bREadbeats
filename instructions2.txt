first off...i guess everything is actually tied to the visualizer, because turning it off and pressing [start] crashes the program.   Can we make the checkbox only shut down the visualizer GUI but not stop the processes tied to it?  if not, that doesn't sound very good for migration to pyqtgraph...but mabye it doesn't matter.


-how does the new low-frequency separation implementation work?  is it properly wired to the [pulse frequency] slider controls on [other] tab? and, used for the tcode-{pulsefrequency} calculation?  are low frequencies processed separately by audioengine?   i'd like to understand how this is actually helping our program do what it needs to do with the better resolution.  and i'm not seeing any evidence of the better resolution helping our cause.   Check everywhere that "dominant audio frequency/audio spectrum/audio frequency influence our strokemapper and strokemodes.  I think it just needs to be wired into the appropriate sliders?

-please make sure any new requirements/modules/hiddenimports are properly put into exe when built (scipy?)


-is there dynamic ranging happening in our visualizer?   it should probably keep same range to really show whats happening.


since all the changes from last instruction seem good, lets go ahead and try migrating the visualizer(s?) to PyQtGraph to save on system resources.
