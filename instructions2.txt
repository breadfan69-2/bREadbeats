-on menu bar [menu], remove {close}, its redundant. 
-on "about" popup, add new lines in middle:

-i want to add a new line to the menu bar, {help}  opens a popup with common issues.  you can format this nicely for me:


no motion?
check [options][audio device] is your current speakers or an input/microphone with an incoming signal.
check [start](starts audio stream detection and visualizer) and [play](starts motion generation) are pressed.
[beat detection] tab -> raise sensitivity, raise audio amplification until you see blinking next to BPM meter.
[beat detection] adjust frequency range


still no motion?
[stroke settings]
check stroke min/max slider
check stroke fullness slider

if using strokemode 1,2,3 
[effects/axis]
if using strokemode 1,2,3 check axis weights sliders.  0 = no motion.


too much motion?
check [audio device] audio amplification, sensitivity, flux multiplier.
check [effects/axis] axis weights sliders
check [tempo tracking] Spectral flux control

RE: TCP CONNECTION AND CONTROLS GROUPBOXES

-can we make these take less vertical space?  let's move audio device selection and host/port input for TCP to a separate menu bar dropdown-"options"
RE: PRESETS/SETTINGS SAVING

i want to add "revert" button next to presets that when clicked will restore last settings before selecting a preset, in case user had a good setting and accidently loads a preset.  So when clicking a preset button, we need to store current settings and attach to "revert" button.  We can store those settings in the same as shutdown location, it is same function, (to prevent accidental loss of good settings) The button should have a circular "go back" type arrow, no text. It will have no function at program loading, or be useless, because its settings are already loaded at program loading.   Make sense?     It can be half the width of the preset buttons.  Place it in the same presets groupbox on the right side.  You may have to redraw 'presets" and "spectrum" groupboxes.  there is plenty of room to the right.

is it possible to make the rangesliders grabbable in the middle, so the actual range can slide?  instead of having to move each tab independently?  in this behavior, the distance between the tabs should stay the same while both tabs travel in the same direction.
