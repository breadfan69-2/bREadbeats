we need to remove all beat tracking locks from all parametars when pressing "stop"

also automatically set auto-ranging sliders to minimum value when toggling auto [on]

i want to cycle the auto ranging differently..can we loop this order, on 1/8 the current timer interval? (can we go that fast??), when [hungting] only.  Use opposite order when [reversing], and original time interval.

hopefully this will dial it in a bit better!



*****************NEW INSTRUCTION********************

-can i please have smaller interval resolution on step length for the autorange sliders and their selector scrollboxes?  with the faster loop i need to go down to 0.0001.  is that possible?  boxes can be wider if necessary, watch window formatting.

-peak floor, peak decay, rise sensitivity are being reset backwards on toggle[autorange].  since their [hunting] motion is backward, they need to reset to their maximum (right side) setting.  
-change peak decay min setting to .2
-change peak floor minimum to 0.5
-change [audio amplification] minimum and reset values to 0.15 and change maximum range to 5 (was 10)


after implementing this, please start the program for verification.   

then, proceed with the rest of instructions5.txt
