Hi expensive claude.  

You helped me start writing this program, but you're too expensive, so i used cheap claude to help get it running the way i want.  its mostly done but i want you to go over it a final time.

----------------------------------------------
First, please look through the WHOLE codebase and 
and check for errors, missing guards, and unnecessary code fragments.  I mistakedly let GPT do a lot of work in here.

RE: JITTER
-circle size range lower limit is now not low enough.  
  lower limit can be 0.01/
-not making proper circular motions any more, check 1-2 commits back for different motion maths for creep.   it is currently smooth semi-circles...that's good, but it needs to be full circles.   It does NOT have to stay on the edge, it can follow downbeat or creep depth.

---------------------

there is a gap between the volume slider and its label in the "control" box. move the label closer.

are we properly lowering sent volume over tcp when {silencedetected}?  if we are, it should show in the display.  the slider however does not need to move.
here's a console snippet when volume was expected to be lowered due to [truly silent]

You might have already fixed this, i'm not sure.

RE:BEAT DETECTION/DOWNBEATS

-the beat detection seems slightly more stable, but its lagging now.  are we queing something?  the downbeats are all "behind".   make sure nothing is ever qued and all events/parameters are sent live.

i think we already implemented one strategy from these refs, what was the next one to implement?  https://github.com/mjhydri/BeatNet

https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~music/cmp/theses/che-yuan_liang_thesis.pdf
https://biff.ai/a-rundown-of-open-source-beat-detection-models/

let's discuss any improvements you find in the above references before implementing any changes to the beat detection.

 Make sure window launch size is adjusted if necessary to not squash/distort any UI elements that we have changed.
