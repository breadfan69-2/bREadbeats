Hi expensive claude!

You helped me start writing this program, you did the GUI layout, but you're too expensive to use for all the little tweaks, so i used cheaper claude to help get it running the way i want.  its mostly done but i want you to go over it again.
----------------------------------------------
First, please look through the WHOLE codebase and 
and check for errors, missing guards, and unnecessary code fragments.  I mistakedly let GPT do a lot of work in here.
------------------------------------------------
RE:STROKEMODES  
Check the {strokemodes}against earlier commits (go back at least 3-5 commits): they seem easy to get borked.  
we also should reduce the maximum of the [axis weights] sliders for stroke modes 1-3.  make the maximum weight 1.25.
do not change the special function of {axis weights} sliders for [strokemode4], it must retain its peak/flux balance properties.
--------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------

RE:GUI [CONTROLS] BOX

the volume slider is not displaying properly.  and make sure it reflects volume change sent in tcode.

-ALSO, the whole top row ([tcp connection][controls])of the GUI is jumping around becasue of the beattracker display updating and changing size.  can you fix that?
---------------------------------
RE:BEAT DETECTION/DOWNBEATS

-the beat detection seems slightly more stable now with the 2 techniques added in previous commits.   are there any parameters for the new techniques that we should add 'adjust' sliders for? 

there was a 3rd addition you suggested...#3 — Comb filter tempo smoothing (medium effort)
From the madmom/TISMIR approach — replace the weighted-average interval method with a resonating comb filter that's more robust to missed/extra beats. Better tempo lock.



   make sure nothing is ever qued and all events/parameters are sent live.

here are the references again just in case:

let's discuss any improvements you find in the above references before implementing any changes to the beat detection.
-----------------------------------------------------
RE: EXE BUILD
there were some issues with missing hidden imports, etc, make sure these are all correct to build standalone exe.

------------------------------------------------------
RE: CONFIG FILE
	are we saving ALL parameters?  it looks like [presets] has a lot more parameters saved than config.  double check all available slider parameters and make sure we've got all of them.
---------------------------------------------
Finally, are there any tweaks we can make to "lighten" the cpu load this program creates?  Anyway to pass some of the load to gpu instead of cpu?   I understand removing a lot of the debugging logging is an option, but not ready for that yet.  Again, discuss any possible changes before implementing.   
-----------------------------------------------
your persistence and extreme care are the only reason this project is turning out this well, thank you!
