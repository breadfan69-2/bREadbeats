Hi expensive claude.  

You helped me start writing this program, but you're too expensive, so i used cheap claude to help get it running the way i want.  its mostly done but i want you to go over it a final time.

----------------------------------------------
First, please look through the WHOLE codebase and check for errors, missing guards, and unnecessary code fragments.  I mistakedly let GPT do a lot of work in here.
-------------------------------------------------------

Should we change the "connection to restim" box in the UI since we seem to be connecting automatically?   instead of "connect" mabye we need "reset".   and change box title from [connection to restim]->[TCP Connection].   can we clean up the host/port selection boxes a bit?  i don't think the scrollwheel is needed for port.
----------------------------------------------------

-what value is the new pulse_freq display showing?   it seems waaaay too high.  is it raw tcode?   if its raw tcode, we need to divide by 500, not multiply.  that's my fault.   the total tcode range of [0000-9999] creates a pulse_freq from 1-200hz.   

-----------------------------------------------------
 -now the beat counter reset is resetting a little too fast on silence.  change threshold?   what is it currently?

---------------------
 Make sure window launch size is adjusted if necessary to not squash/distort any UI elements that we have changed.


please complete these instructions, stop and ask any questions you need for clarification.
