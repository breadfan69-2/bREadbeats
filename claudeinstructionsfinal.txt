Hi expensive claude.  

You helped me start writing this program, but you're too expensive, so i used cheap claude to help get it running the way i want.  its mostly done but i want you to go over it a final time.

----------------------------------------------
First, please look through the WHOLE codebase and check for errors, missing guards, and unnecessary code fragments.  I mistakedly let GPT do a lot of work in here.  Check against original 5-6 commits and make sure [strokemode1] has not changed one single bit.  [strokemode2] and [strokemode3] have improvements that are to be kept.   [strokemode4] should be as originally implemented but with the functioning flux/peak sliders added.
-------------------------------------------------------
-can we make a pop-up dialogue when rightclicking preset buttons to save, a double check warning before saving and overwriting?  [WARNING - OVERWRITE PRESET]  and buttons for "confirm" and "cancel"?

-------------------------------------------


-it looks like our autoconnect to TCP logic doesn't happen until pressing [start] for audio monitoring.  This is confusing to the user.  We should auto connect when the program starts.

---------------------

-the beat detector display jumps around a lot.  is our beat pickup really that inconsistent?  can we do any better on the logic?  read these references and lets talk about what could possibly be better, if anything:  https://github.com/mjhydri/BeatNet

 Make sure window launch size is adjusted if necessary to not squash/distort any UI elements that we have changed.


please complete these instructions, stop and ask any questions you need for clarification.
