Hi expensive claude.  

You helped me start writing this program, but you're too expensive, so i used cheap claude to help get it running the way i want.  its mostly done but i want you to go over it a final time.

----------------------------------------------
First, please look through the WHOLE codebase and 
and check for errors, missing guards, and unnecessary code fragments.  I mistakedly let GPT do a lot of work in here.

---------------------

there is a gap between the volume slider and its label in the "control" box. move the label closer.

RE:BEAT DETECTION/DOWNBEATS

-the beat detection seems slightly more stable now with the 2 techniques added in the last 2 commits.   are there any parameters for the new techniques that we should add adjust sliders for? 

there was a 3rd addition you suggested...#3 — Comb filter tempo smoothing (medium effort)
From the madmom/TISMIR approach — replace the weighted-average interval method with a resonating comb filter that's more robust to missed/extra beats. Better tempo lock.



   make sure nothing is ever qued and all events/parameters are sent live.

here are the references again just in case:

let's discuss any improvements you find in the above references before implementing any changes to the beat detection.

YOU ARE ROCKING THIS PROJECT!
