last edits were dealing with the arc timing- we added a "wait" for next beat at anchor.  it solved the drifting problem, but i don't like it.

change the "wait" beahavior to calculate time to next, will be much better.

NEED CALCULATE TIME OF STROKE INSTEAD OF WAITING----NEEDS TO KEEP MOVING SMOOTHLY
 
UPDATE

the dot is still sitting and waiting a bit>


its really not a "find something else to do" situation...we want all the rotations to be a relatively [even speed], [without wait], [without creep(if there is good beat detected)] 

we need to use the detected bpm to calculate the speed of the dots motion relative to how many beats/rotation we are looking for, does that clarify?

we also need to account for any acceleration that is built in, or "thump" effect's influence on speed and arc timing.

we need to account for these "effects" because they will always be throwing timing off..

this will be different maths process for EVERY arc....to keep the timing proper....

we need the next arc to start immediately after the last one has completed
with travel time already calculated by the beat interval
-----------UPDATE 2==============


"The core fix: when an arc finishes in FULL_STROKE mode with a good BPM, immediately start another arc instead of dropping to idle/creep. Real beat events override the continuation arc when they arrive (phase correction), but the dot never stops rotating."

-WHAT IS 'CONTINUATION ARC'?  IS THAT WHAT WE ARE CALLING THE PRE-PLANNED ARC THAT NEEDS TO BE FIRED OFF AS SOON AS THE LAST ONE LANDS?

-this might have helped.  its still waiting sometimes but have much more consistent motion.   

-we should still be looking for 1 completion of arc over 2 beats>
(we got confused when building strokemapperv2)

-we need to watch upper end of audio spectrum- mabye <2000 hz?, and if flux drops off signifigantly, go back to creep-edge or center-wait.

-change any "wait" behavoir to go back to center and jitter if there has been no beat confirmed for 2sec

-currently our beat confirmation rule is (i think):
traffic light green or yellow with metronome green OR
traffic light green with metronome green or yellow
*- add more acceptable states:
[-OR- traffic light yellow after leaving green and metronome yellow/green]
[-OR- metronome green (stable, more than 2000ms) but traffic light red]

_____________UPDATE 3__________________

CAN'T WE CALCULATE THE SPEED A LITTLE BETTER TO AVOID WAITING WHEN THERE IS CONFIRMED "GOOD" BEAT?  REGARDLESS OF 'NUMBER OF ARC COMPLETIONS' PER BEAT?

ITS GETTING BETTER BUT ITS STILL WAITING- THOUGH LESS.  WE ALSO NEED TO TRY BETTER TO HIT TOP ON BEAT ONCE A BEAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, HOW CAN WE DO THAT?  WE WERE ANCHORING TO TOP OR BOTTOM, [WHICHEVER WAS CLOSER] BEFORE.  CAN WE DO THAT, BUT WITHOUT WAITING THERE?
